## Measure the surface tension of water

<img src="water.png" width="30%" align="right"/></a>

### Description

Molecular dynamics simulation of a slab of water in contact with vacuum. The water model is TIP4P/2005. The surface tension is measured from the difference between the stresses normal and parallel to the liquid-vapour interface. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_APjA5_wZc) has been made with this script.

### How to

Execute the input.lammps file using LAMMPS. Visualize the dump file using VMD, and extract the temperature and surface tension from the two data files.
