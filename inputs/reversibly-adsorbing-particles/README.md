## Adsorption combined with diffusion create pink noise in nanopore

### Description

The simulation consists of particles diffusing inside a cylindrical nanopore. The surface of the nanopore is covered with adsorbing sites, and the particles reversibly adsorb at the inner surface of the nanopore. The adsorption/desorption processes are modelled using bond/create and bond/break commands respectively. A bond forms if a particle comes close enough to a trap. An additional harmonic potential is added to trapped particles. The wall of the cylinder is modelled using the wall/region command.
