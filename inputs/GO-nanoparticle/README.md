<img align="right" width="30%" src="GO-nanoparticle.png">

### Description

The simulation consists of a single graphene oxide particle with a few water molecules.
The initial GO nanoparticle has been generated using [make graphitics](https://github.com/velocirobbie/make-graphitics).
This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DaTJFEyUmI) has been made with this script.

### How to

Run the input.lammps file using LAMMPS, and visualise the 'dump' output using VMD. If you are new to LAMMPS and VMD, you can find [tutorials and instructions here](https://lammpstutorials.github.io/).
