# Generation of amorphous carbon structure using the liquid quench method

<img align="right" width="30%" src="amorphous-carbon.png">

### Description

LAMMPS input for carbon atoms, initially in the liquid state (high temperature). The temperature of the system is decreased progressively until hexagonal rings form. The final state is an amorphous nanoporous structure of carbon. This [video](https://youtu.be/P6M7mJdh7uM) has been made with this script.

### How to

Execute the input.lammps file using LAMMPS. Visualize the dump file using VMD.
