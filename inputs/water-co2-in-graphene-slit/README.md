## Water-CO2 mixture confined in a graphene nanoslit

### Description

The simulation consists of a 2D layer of water and co2 confined between graphene sheets.

### How to

Run the make_graphene jupyter notebook to generate the initial graphite slits. Then, run the input.SOLVATE.lammps file using LAMMPS.  Visualise the '.lammpstrj' output using VMD. If you are new to LAMMPS and VMD, you can find [tutorials and instructions here](https://lammpstutorials.github.io/).
