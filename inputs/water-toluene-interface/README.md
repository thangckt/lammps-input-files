### Description

Molecular dynamics simulation of a slab of initially mixed water and toluene molecules in contact with vacuum. The temperature is maintained at 300K. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFG4MNJ5K10) has been made with this script.

### How to

Execute the input.lammps file using LAMMPS. Visualize the dump file using VMD.
